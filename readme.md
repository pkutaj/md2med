| `md2med_SCRIPT` | path to `md2med.py`                    |
| `cacert`        | path to `cacert.pem`                   |

* download `cacert.pem` from [curl - Extract CA Certs from Mozilla](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html) 
* create an environment variable `cacert` with the value of the path pointing to the cert file
* now you are ready to run the script 
* navigate to the folder where you have your markdown file you want to publish
* call `md2med.py` ideally via environmental variable so that don't have to copy it to the folder with markdown file with the following parameters:
    - `--doc_name` -> random title
    - `--file_to_publish` -> file name
    - `--tag` ->

```powershell
# no environmental vars
python .\md2med.py --doc_name "hello there!" --file_to_publish "./test_doc.md" --tag "python"
# with environmental var in PowerShell
python $env:md2med_SCRIPT --doc_name "hello there!" --file_to_publish "./test_doc.md" --tag "python"
```
